  disk-models:
  - name: CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS

    # This example is based on using a single 1TB disk for a volume
    # group that contains all file systems on a controller with 64GB
    # of memory.
    #
    # Additional disks can be added to the 'physical-volumes' section.
    #
    #

    volume-groups:
      - name: hlm-vg
        physical-volumes:

          # NOTE: 'sda_root' is a templated value. This value is checked in
          # os-config and replaced by the partition actually used on sda
          #e.g. sda1 or sda5
          - /dev/sda_root

          # Add any additional disks for the volume group here
          # -/dev/sdx
          # -/dev/sdy

        logical-volumes:
          # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
          # At least 5% should be left free for snapshots. This example leaves 18%
          # free to allow for some flexibility.

    # Cinder: cinder volume needs temporary local filesystem space to convert
    # images to raw when creating bootable volumes. Using a separate volume
    # will both ringfence this space and avoid filling /

    # the number of concurrent bootable volume creations.

    # dedicated volume group.
