  disk-models:
  - name: CONTROLLER-DISKS

    # This example is based on using a single 500GB disk for a volume
    # group that contains all file systems on a controller with 64GB
    # of memory.
    #
    # Additional disks can be added to the 'physical-volumes' section.
    #
    # If the available capacity of your servers is more that 500GB you
    # should consider using the "CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS" disk-model
    # in disks_controller_1TB.yml instead.  To use this alternative model
    # you need to edit the CONTROLLER-ROLE sections of server_roles.yml
    #

      - name: hlm-vg
        physical-volumes:

          # NOTE: 'sda_root' is a templated value. This value is checked in
          # os-config and replaced by the partition actually used on sda
          #e.g. sda1 or sda5
          - /dev/sda_root

          # Add any additional disks for the volume group here
          # -/dev/sdx
          # -/dev/sdy

        logical-volumes:
          # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
          # 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.
